# openGEDCOM
The openGEDCOM file specification is a set of standards that allow the community to interchange genealogical information without loss of meta data. This standard is not owned by any one entity. It is open and maintained by the community.

## Table of Contents
* [Version](version.md)
* [Header](header.md)
* [Names](names.md)
* [Individuals](individuals.md)
* [Sex](sex.md)
* [Families](families.md)
* [Groups](groups.md)
* [Sources](sources.md)
* [Events](events.md)
* [DNA](sources.md#dna)
* [Digital Media](sources.md#photo)
* [Dates](dates.md)
* [User extensions](extensions.md)

## Other Standards
* [Cousin List](cousins.md)
* [Family Archive](familyarchive.md)

## Examples
The following are examples of a full openGEDCOM. The Full example is more comprehensive, while the simplified one contains less meta data to provide a higher level view of the structure of the document. The intent is that these files become a type of ["acid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3) test for software products to use as a guide in their implementation.

* [Full Example](example_full.json)
* [Simplified Example](example_simple.json)

### Alternate Approach
Another approach to an openGEDCOM specification could be using [schema.org](https://schema.org). Here is an [example](../schema.org/index.md) of how that would look.
