                                    INTRODUCTION


GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints to meet the data communication requirements of the Family
History Department and other institutions wishing to exchange computerized
genealogical data.  GEDCOM is an acronym for GEnealogical Data Communication. 
GEDCOM is provided to foster the exchange of genealogical information and the
development of a wide range of inter-operable software products to assist
genealogists, historians, and other researchers in the exchange of genealogical
information.

Purpose and Content of This Document

This technical document is written for computer programmers, system developers, and
user specialists.  It defines a flexible format for exchanging structured
genealogical information between different computer systems. 

The chapters in this document detail the following specifications: 

      *     Data Representation Grammar   *     Values
      *     Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Grammar *     Character Sets
      *     GEDCOM Transmission File                  

This document describes GEDCOM in two different levels.  The lower level defines a
general-purpose data representation language for representing any kind of structured
information in a sequential media.  This lower level is known as the GEDCOM data
format.  It deals with the syntax and identification of structured information in
general, but does not deal with the semantic content of any particular kind of data.

The higher level defines specific content for a particular kind of data to be
exchanged between a group of compatible systems.  GEDCOM has been used for many
different kinds of data.  Each kind of data is referred to as a form of GEDCOM and
has its own definition at this level.  GEDCOM forms have been defined for lineage-
linked, bibliographic, census, religious, and other kinds of data, including several
that are not related to genealogy. 

The first two chapters are presented as language grammars and are technically
oriented. Chapter 1 presents basic GEDCOM concepts and then defines the lower-level
GEDCOM format.  This chapter will be useful to anyone using GEDCOM.  Chapter 2
defines the higher-level, specific form of GEDCOM known as the lineage-linked form. 
The lineage-linked form is the form used by commercial genealogical software systems
for exchanging compiled, linked information about individuals.  The other forms of
GEDCOM are not publicly exchanged at this time, and are not discussed in this
document. 

Chapters three and four discuss GEDCOM in a more tutorial fashion.  If
inconsistencies are present, they should be resolved in favor of the grammars
presented in the first two chapters.  The fifth chapter defines GEDCOM character
sets.  Appendix A defines tags used in the lineage-linked form of GEDCOM.  Appendix
B contains character tables that define the GEDCOM character set.

Changes in Version 5.0

Prior official versions of The GEDCOM Standard were released in October 1987 (3.0)
and August 1989 (4.0).  Versions prior to these were preliminary and were not
established as a standard.

This GEDCOM release (5.0) includes the first standard definition of the lineage-
linked form of GEDCOM, and also includes the first major expansion of the lineage-
linked form since its initial use in GEDCOM 3.0. Products based on releases 3.0 and
4.0 versions should be upward-compatible. These existing registered GEDCOM-
compatible systems should still be able to exchange data with newer systems that use
this version, and will still be considered GEDCOM-compatible. 

There are several purposes for the 5.0 release of GEDCOM:

      *     Re-define the GEDCOM data representation grammar in a shorter, more
            rigorous, and more precise format, for ease of understanding (see
            chapter 1).  The GEDCOM format remains the same, even though the
            description of it is changed.

      *     Define the precise combinations of tags, values, and pointers allowed in
            the lineage-linked form (see chapter 2).  This is the form of GEDCOM
            currently exchanged by commercial genealogical software systems, and it
            remains unchanged, other than adding new tags and the upward-compatible 
            structural extensions listed below.  (The lineage-linked form should not
            be confused with other forms of GEDCOM, which apply the basic GEDCOM
            data format with different tag, value, and pointer combinations for
            other purposes.)

      *     Define representations for supporting information such as source
            citations, submitter identification, and notes.  (See chapter 2,
            <<SUPPORT_INFO>> structure in the lineage-linked grammar.)

      *     Define user-defined EVENts.

      *     Define user-defined ASSOciations with INDIviduals other than direct
            family relationships.

      *     Allow descriptive text to further qualify MARRiage, DIVorce, and other
            event structures.

      *     Require SOURce VERSion (product version) and GEDCom VERSion information.

      *     Define DATE modifier (ABT, BEF, AFT, etc.) and a more rigorous regular
            date format.

GEDCOM Product Registration

Developers of GEDCOM-compatible products using the lineage-linked form of GEDCOM
(see chapter 2) should register their product by submitting the following
information to the GEDCOM coordinator:

      *     A sharable, brief, representative sample of GEDCOM output from their
            product, on diskette, for registration review and for compatibility
            testing by other developers
      *     A proposed unique SOURce name to identify the product (not the company),
            up to 40 characters long, allowing mixed upper and lower case, with no
            embedded spaces (use underscore "_" instead), for inclusion in the
            product's GEDCOM output HEADer record
      *     An optional text file containing relevant technical documentation about
            the product's GEDCOM implementation.

GEDCOM Software Library

A library of public domain source code, in the C programming language, is available
to help reduce the work required to achieve GEDCOM compatibility.

                             DATA REPRESENTATION GRAMMAR


INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the core GEDCOM data representation language, which provides
a general purpose way to represent items of related information using a sequential
stream of characters.  At this generic level, GEDCOM may be used to represent any
form of structured information, not just genealogical data.

CONCEPTS

A GEDCOM transmission represents a database in the form of a sequential stream of
related records.  A record is represented as a sequence of tagged, variable-length
lines, arranged in a hierarchy.  A line contains a hierarcical level number, a tag,
and a value.  The GEDCOM line is terminated by a carriage return and/or line feed
character.

The tag identifies the value of a line in the same sense as a field name identifies
a field in a database record.  The data is self-defining.  Tags allow a field to
occur any number of times within a record, including zero, and allow the use of
different or new fields without otherwise penalizing compatibility between different
systems exchanging data.

The hierarchical relationships are indicated by a hierarchical level number. 
Subordinate lines have a higher level number.  The hierarchy allows a line to have
sub-lines, which in turn may have their own sub-lines, etc.  A line and its sub-
lines constitute a context or enclosure, that is, a cluster of information
pertaining directly to the same thing.  This hierarchical arrangement corresponds
with the natural hierarchy found in most structured information.

The beginning of a record is indicated by a line whose level number is zero.

A GEDCOM receiver system scans the input for expected information by looking for
specific tags and processing the associated values.  Unrecognized tags (perhaps from
a sending system whose database contains some different information) are handled by
not processing the associated value nor its enclosed sub-lines, i.e, the entire
context is ignored.  These are treated as exceptions by printing them in an
exception report or saving them in some generic way.

In addition to hierarchical relationships, GEDCOM defines inter-record references
which allow a record to be logically related to other records, without introducing
redundancy.  These are represented by two additional, but optional, parts of a line:
a cross-reference pointer and a cross-reference identifier.  The cross-reference
pointer "points at" a related record, identified by a required matching cross-
reference identifier.

GRAMMAR

The GEDCOM data format, a data representation language, is defined in the grammar in
this chapter.  The grammar is a set of rules that specify what sequences of
characters constitute valid GEDCOM expressions.  The rules are expressed as a set of
pattern definitions, where each pattern is defined in terms of more primitive
patterns.  Pattern definitions consist of the pattern name, a separator ":=", and a
list of sub-patterns from which one alternative is selected.  To read the grammar,
components of the selected pattern are substituted recursively by other patterns or
constants, continuing until all patterns are resolved into constants.  Pattern names
are in bold print.  Constants are the actual symbols that appear in the complete
expressions and are not bolded.

A GEDCOM transmission consists of a sequence of physical records, each of which
consists of a sequence of gedcom_lines, all contained in a sequential file or
stream of characters.  The beginning of a new physical record is designated by a
line whose level number is 0.  Physical records are intended to be small enough to
fit within available memory, though absolute limits are not established.  A
gedcom_line has the following syntax:

gedcom_line:=
      level delimtr xref_id delimtr tag delimtr line_content terminator

      *     The gedcom_line represents one piece of information.  One
            gedcom_line corresponds to one field in traditional database or file
            terminology, or to a grouping of fields as in a record or subrecord. 
            The concepts of fields, records, and subrecords merge together in
            GEDCOM.

      *     The total length of a GEDCOM line does not exceed 255 characters.

      *     Leading white space (tabs, spaces) to a GEDCOM line should be ignored by
            the reading system.  Systems outputing GEDCOM should not have any white
            space in front of the GEDCOM line (at least for the near future).

      *     The xref_id and line_content are optional.

      The following are examples of valid (though unrelated) GEDCOM lines:

            0 @1234@ INDI

            1 AGE 13

            1 CHIL @1234@

      The first line has a level number 0, a xref_id of @1234@, an INDI tag, and
      no line_content.

      The second line has a level number 1, no xref_id, an AGE tag, and a
      line_content value of 13.

      The third line has a level number 1, no xref_id, a CHIL tag, and a
      line_content of a pointer to a xref_id named @1234@.

level:=
      digit
      digit level

      The level number works the same way as the level of indentation in an
      indented outline, where indented lines provide detail about the item under
      which they are indented.  A line at any level L is enclosed by and pertains
      directly to the nearest preceding line at level L-1.  The Level L may only
      increase by at most 1.

      The enclosed subordinate lines at level L are said to be in the context of the
      enclosing superior line at level L-1.  The meaning of a tag (see tag below)
      is interpreted in the context of the tags of the enclosing line(s).  Take the
      following record about an individual's birth and death dates, for example:

            0 INDI
              1 BIRT
                2 DATE 12 MAY 1920
              1 DEAT
                2 DATE 1960

      In this example, the expression DATE 12 MAY 1920 is interpreted within the
      INDI BIRTH context, representing the INDIvidual's BIRTh DATE.  The second DATE
      is in the INDI DEAT (death) context.  The complete meaning of DATE depends on
      the context.  (Note: the above example is indented according to the level
      numbers to make the concept more obvious.  In the actual GEDCOM data there is
      no indentation, just level numbers lined up vertically on the left margin.)


xref_id:=
      @xref_text@

      The xref_id (cross reference identifier) is the target for pointers,
      allowing physically separate records to reference each other logically.  The
      at signs "@" delimit the xref_text.  The xref_text is unique within a
      GEDCOM transmission, and is between 1 and 15 characters in length.

      The purpose of the xref_text is to uniquely identify a record in the
      transmission.  Receiving systems typically map xref_text into their own
      internal record identifiers, maintaining the relationships between records but
      not necessarily the xref_text values used in the transmission.  The
      xref_text typically consists of some form of the internal record identifier
      from the database of the sending system.

      A record with a matching xref_id must exist for every pointer in the
      transmission, unless the colon ":" character is present in the pointer,
      indicating a network reference (future) to a permanent record that might not
      be in the transmission.  The colon ":" character is therefore reserved within
      xref_ids and pointers.  The colon ":" character restriction does not apply
      to the other parts of a GEDCOM_line.

delimtr:=
      space

      The delimtr (delimiter), (a single space character), terminates both the
      variable-length level number and the tag.  Note that space characters may
      also be present in a value.

tag:=
      letter
      tag letter
      tag digit

      A tag consists of a variable length sequence of letters and digits,
      beginning with a letter.  The tag represents the meaning of the
      line_content within the context of the enclosing lines.  Specific tags are
      defined in Appendix A.  

      Although existing tags are only three or four characters long, systems should
      prepare to handle tags from 1 to 15 characters in length, terminated by a
      delimtr.

      Valid combinations of specific tags, values, xref_ids and  pointers are
      further constrained by the GEDCOM form defined for representing a given kind
      of information (see Chapter 2 for the Lineage-Linked form grammar).

line_content:=
      value
      pointer
      value pointer
      escape_sequence
      escape_sequence value

      The line_content identifies an object within the domain of possible values
      allowed in the context of the tag.  The combination of the tag, the
      line_content, and the line_content of the preceeding superior line (level
      N - 1) is a 3-tuple that defines an association between the two objects.  A
      pointer stands in the place of the context identified by the matching
      xref_id.  Theoretically, a receiving system should be prepared to follow a
      pointer to find any needed value in a manner that is transparent to the
      logic of the subsystem that is looking for specific tags.  This highly-
      flexible facility will probably be used more in the future.  For the time
      being, however, the use of pointers is explicitly defined within the GEDCOM
      form.  The value pointer  combination is used to indicate what kind of
      association or relationship exists between the current record and the record
      being pointed to. (See chapter 2).  The  escape_sequence grammar is used to
      specify special processing, such as switching character sets or calendars for
      date interpretation, and for indicating an inclusion of a non_gedcom data form
      into the GEDCOM structure.

terminator:=
      carriage_return
      line_feed
      carriage_return line_feed
      line_feed carriage_return

      The terminator delimits the variable-length line_content and signals the
      end of the line.

      NOTE: Some existing systems provide an option to produce an indented GEDCOM
      output for user readability, using space or tab characters between the
      terminator and the level number of the next line to visibly show the
      hierarchy.  Also, some have suggested allowing extra blank lines to visibly
      separate physical records.  These features may be incorporated into the GEDCOM
      standard at some future time, but for now, such a change would render some
      existing systems incompatible.  Therefore, we recommend that new systems be
      prepared to discard extra carriage returns, line feeds, spaces and tabs
      immediately preceeding the level number during input, though output for now
      should normally be constrained as specified above, without indentation or
      blank lines.

xref_text:=
      letter
      digit
      punctuation
      space
      xref_text xref_text

      The xref_text is any arbitrary combination of characters, except for the at-
      sign "@" and the terminator.  The xref_text is not retained by the
      receiving system, and may therefore be formed from any convenient combination
      of identifiers from the sending system.  No meaning is attributed by the
      receiver to any part of the xref_text, except for its unique association
      with the corresponding record.  The use of the colon ":" character is
      reserved. To avoid confusion with the escape sequence prefix "@#", a xref_text
      must not begin with a pound sign "#". 

value:=
      letter
      digit
      punctuation
      space
      colon
      value value

      The value represents an object within the domain of the full context of the
      accompanying tag.  This domain is defined by a specific grammar for
      representing a given GEDCOM form (see Chapters 2 for Lineage-Linked grammar).

      Values are not encoded in binary or other schemes for reducing space
      requirements, and they are generally constrained to be understandable by a
      typical user without decoding.  This is intended to reduce the decoding burden
      on the receiving software.  A GEDCOM-optimized data compression standard will
      be defined in the future to reduce space requirements.  Meanwhile, users may
      agree to compress GEDCOM files using any compression system available to both
      sender and receiver.

pointer:=
      xref_text

      The pointer represents the association between two objects that reside in
      different physical records.  Complex logical records are divided into smaller
      physical records to accommodate memory constraints, many to many
      relationships, and independent record creation.

      The pointer must match a corresponding xref_id within the transmission,
      unless the colon ":" character is present (future network reference to a
      permanent record).  A pointer is given instead of duplicating the object
      identified in the value of the line pointed at, though the logical result is
      equivalent.  An expanded traversal of a record tree includes following the
      pointers to related records to some depth, and splicing those records
      (logically) into the resultant expanded tree. Pointers may refer to either
      records which have not yet appeared in the transmission (forward reference) or
      to records that have already appeared earlier in the transmission (backward
      reference).  This arrancement usually requires a preliminary pass to construct
      a lookup table to support random access by xref_id during subsequent passes.
      

      A few GEDCOM structures allow the sending system to use either a pointer or a
      value within the same context (with the same tag and enclosing tags), and
      sometimes the line will contain both a value and pointer.  In all cases, the
      pointer will be at either the beginning or the ending of the line_content,
      never in the middle.  GEDCOM receiving systems should be prepared in certain
      cases to follow pointers recursively and "splice" either text or compound
      GEDCOM structures into the position occupied by the pointer.  Assembling
      pointer-based structures into large segments of text may require staging the
      text in disk-based files to accommodate memory constraints.  Specific
      requirements are defined in lower-level GEDCOM grammars for a particular form
      of GEDCOM data (see Chapter 2 for Lineage-Linked grammar).
            
letter:=
      One of the letters A-Z, a-z, plus all diacritic and special characters from
      the GEDCOM character set.

digit:=
      One of the digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

punctuation:=
      One of the non-letter  and non-digit characters from the GEDCOM character
      set, except the space and colon ":" characters.  The colon ":" character may
      be used within a value.

      The at sign "@" is used for an escape mechanism to identify pointers, 
      xref_id, character set changes, calendar changes, or other shifts in
      representation rules.  To include the at sign "@" as data in a value, two of
      them should be sent together "@@", which represent a single at sign "@" as
      data.

escape_sequence:=
      @#Dcalendar_type@
      @#Ccharacter_set@
      @#Lescape_codes_with_length@ inclusion_data
      @#Ffile_reference_escape_codes@


calendar_type :=
      A reserved name indicating which calendar base should be used to interpret the
      associated date value (see section in chapter 4 on "How to Record Dates").

character_set :=
      A reserved name indicating which character set should be used to interpret the
      codes contained in the associated value.

escape_codes_with_length :=
      data_type_code delimtr data_length
      This escape sequence indicates the inclusion of data of a non-gedcom structure
      is to be enclosed within the context of the GEDCOM structure.  The
      data_length defines the length of the data being included (note: this
      length is not constrained by the 255 character line limit adopted for standard
      GEDCOM form and may be arbitrarily long).  The data_type_code defines the
      form of the inclusion data. The specific rules and type codes have not yet
      been standardized.  Reading systems should skip over the length of data
      indicated if they are not prepared to process the indicated data type.
            
data_type_code :=
      A reserved one-letter code indicating what data form is contained in the
      inclusion data.

data_length :=
      digit
      digit digit
      A decimal number in ASCII digits, indicating the count of characters contained
      in the inclusion_data.

      This data becomes the line content value whose type and size are defined by
      the associated escape sequence. 

file_reference_escape_codes :=
      file_type_code file_path_name
      This escape sequence allows both GEDCOM and NON-GEDCOM data to be transmitted
      in a separate file for a logical inclusion within this GEDCOM context.  Note:
      the data length of the file is not constrained by the 255 character line limit
      adopted for standard GEDCOM form.  Systems not prepared to process the
      indicated type of file should skip past the filename to continue processing.

file_type_code :=
      A reserved one letter code indicating what type of data is contained in the
      inclusion file.  Specific types have not yet been standardized.

file_path_name :=
      This is the path name required for accessing the inclusion file from within
      the current directory.  In PC-DOS terms, this means either that a path must be
      fully specified, including the root directory and optional drive, or that a
      partial path refers to a file within the same directory as the GEDCOM
      transmission file or within a directory subordinate to the current directory.

                               LINEAGE-LINKED GRAMMAR

INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes specific tag, value, and pointer combinations for exchanging
lineage-linked information in the GEDCOM format.  Lineage-linked data pertains to
individuals linked in family relationships across multiple generations.

This lineage-linked grammar is based on the general framework of the GEDCOM data
representation grammar defined in the previous chapter.  These two layers define the
GEDCOM format used by commercial genealogical software systems to exchange data. 
Other specialized GEDCOM-based grammars have been created for different purposes. 
Other uses of the general-purpose GEDCOM data representation should not be confused
with this specific usage for lineage-linked genealogical data, as defined in this
chapter, which is the only form of GEDCOM exchanged by commercial genealogical
software systems at this time.

LINEAGE-LINKED GRAMMAR ORGANIZATION

This lineage-linked GEDCOM grammar is organized into three levels: structure
components, substructure patterns, and primitive elements.  Structures and
substructures are indicated by enclosing the structure name within double angle
<<brackets>>.  Primitive element patterns are enclosed in single angle <brackets>. 
The definition of each structure consists of the structure name, a ":=" separator,
and the structure's component pattern. This pattern is an enclosure of GEDCOM lines
composed of primitive elements and/or substructure enclosures.

The record structures of the lineage-linked form are shown in the section 'RECORD
STRUCTURES OF THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM'. The supporting substructures contained that
make up each of the record types are shown in alphabetic sequence in the section
'SUBSTRUCTURES OF THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM'.  The primitive elements are the lowest
level (terminal) components that are not further divided and are shown in the
section 'DEFINITION OF PRIMITIVE ELEMENTS' in alphabetic sequence.

Some elements have optional sub-pattern choices.  These choices are shown by listing
the alternative sub-patterns between opening and closing square brackets "[]" and
separating each choice with a vertical bar "|", meaning that exactly one of the
alternate substitutions must be selected.

The number of occurences of a sub-pattern allowed within a pattern is defined in an
occurence definition in braces "{}" on each line.  This number indicates the minimum
and maximum number of occurrences allowed for a pattern component in the form
{minimum:maximum}.  Note that minimum and maximum occurrence limits are defined
relative to the enclosing superior line.  The enclosing line may prescribe zero,
one, or many possible occurences, which, in effect, is multiplied by the occurences
allowed for any of its subordinate lines.  This means that a required line (minimum
= 1) is not required if an optional enclosing line is not given.  Similarly a line
occurring only once (Maximum = 1) may occur multiple times as long as each occurs
under its own multiple-occurring superior line.

The level numbers for any sub-structure are represented as "n", "+1", "+2", etc. so
that they may be used in more than one place at different starting level numbers. In
these cases, "n" equals the same level number where the pattern first appears, and
the "+1" means level n+1, "+2" means level n+2, etc.

Unless stated otherwise, the only ordering imposed on GEDCOM lines within an
enclosure arises when multiple opinions or other items are presented for which only
one may be expected by a receiving system.  For example, a person may have been
known by more than one name, or evidence may suggest either a birth in 1840 in New
York or in 1837 in Pennsylvania.  In this case, the most credible or preferred
information is listed first, followed by less credible or less preferred items of
conflicting or alternate information.  Receiving systems that can only use one item
of a given kind should use the first-listed value.  The same is true for output
documents that can only display one value, such as family group records, pedigree
charts, and others.

Conflicting dates or places of an event should be represented in separate event
structures to provide a place for the corresponding source citations, rather than
place multiple dates or multiple places under the same enclosing event line.

Even though no other ordering is defined beyond the one described above, some GEDCOM
programming tools optimize performance based on the assumption that tags generally
appear in a typical order.  Performance will be better in these circumstances when a
common sequence is followed.  Therefore, sending systems are encouraged to present
GEDCOM structures in the same general order as the one given in these patterns,
unless there is a sufficient reason to use a different sequence.  

RECORD STRUCTURES OF THE LINEAGE-LINKED FORM

LINEAGE_LINKED_GEDCOM:=
    This is a model of the Lineage-Linked Gedcom structure for submitting data to
    other lineaged-linked GEDCOM processing systems.  A header and a trailer record
    are required and they enclose any number of data records. A data record is
    either a SUBMitter, INDIvidual, FAMily, NOTE, or SOURce record structure.
    0  <<HEADER>>                                              {1:1}           
    0  <<RECORD>>                                              {0:M}           
    0 TRLR                                                     {1:1}           

NOTE:
    There are certain subordinate structures that may occur under any tag, at any
    level. These structures are contained within a structure called SUPPORT_INFO.
    The SUPPORT_INFO structure should be considered as subordinate to any GEDCOM
    line, even though it is not shown (for readability).  The SUPPORT_INFO
    structure may occur from zero to many times {0:M}.  Each occurance of the
    SUPPORT_INFO structure contains exactly one logical choice of one of the
    subordinate SUPPORT_INFO structure components. This means that from none to all
    of the structures from SUPPORT_INFO could appear as subordinate to any GEDCOM
    line, however, some may not be locigal, for instance one would not expect to
    see a DATE tag as subordinate to another DATE tag.
 
HEADER:=
    The header structure provides information for identifying the submitted data. 
    Specific system names are reserved to identify which system sent the data and
    in some cases which system is intended to receive it.  The DESTination system
    name "ANSTFILE" is required for submission to the Family History Department's
    Ancestral File system.  For LDS temple ordinance submissions, the required
    DESTination name is "TempleReady". (See chapter 3, "How To Use A Header" for
    detail.)

     the event being cited.  For example, if the event was a purchase of a primary
     residence, one would show this by using the EVEN tag followed by the phrase
     "Purchased Residence".   When the event descriptor primitive is used with any
     of the defined event tags, it is to modify the basic definition of the
     associated tag.  For example the BIRT tag could be used in connection with an
     EVENT_DESCRIPTOR of 'Stillborn' to modify the birth event as a stillborn
     birth.  The event descriptor should use the same word or phrase and in the
     same language, when possible, that was used by the recorder of the event. 
     Systems that display data from the GEDCOM form should be able to display the
     descriptor value in their output, possibly inside of parenthesis ().

     A XREF is either of type pointer or of type cross reference identifier.  If
     the enclosed value appears before the tag in a GEDCOM-line, then it is a cross
     reference identifier type.  If it appears after the tag in a GEDCOM-line, then
     it is a pointer type.  The method of delimiting a pointer or cross reference
     identifiers in a GEDCOM-line is to enclose  the pointer or cross reference
     identifier within at-signs "@", i.e. @I123@.  A XREF may not begin with a
     pound sign "#".  This is to avoid confusion with an escape sequence prefix
     "@#".  The colon ":" is reserved for future network reference.

     A numeric representation of the calendar year in which an event occurred. 
     Years less than 3 digits long will be treated as a number in a phrase.

COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS GEDCOM VERSIONS

Roots III and GRIOT Alternative products implemented a source citation structure
prior to GEDCOM release 5.0 which is slightly incompatible.  Compatibility with
these products may be maintained by doing the following:

1.   Treat a TITL tag as if it were a SOUR tag.
2.   Treat the text value of a TITL tag at level 0 as if it were the value of the
     NAME tag within the SOURce enclosure.Chapter 3

INTRODUCTION

This chapter contains information you need to implement GEDCOM transmissions.  This
includes examples for creating header and trailer records, and for the conventions
in naming your transmission file.

HEADERS AND TRAILERS IN THE GEDCOM TRANSMISSION

An example of how the header and trailer records appear in GEDCOM lineage-linked
format is shown below:

The example on the preceding page is a sample transmission of genealogical
information about three individuals who are members of the same family (lineage)--
husband, wife, and child. The lines making up the information appear between the
header (HEAD) and trailer (TRLR) records.


WHY HEADERS AND TRAILERS ARE USED

GEDCOM data format is used to transfer a wide variety of data to a wide variety of
computer systems. The Family History Department's Receiving and Routing System uses
header and trailer records to route the information in each GEDCOM transmission to
the right place. In the sample at the beginning of this chapter, PAF (SOUR) 2.1
(VERS)--the sending system name and version--is routing the information to ANSTFILE
(Ancestral File)--the destination (DEST). To enable processing of GEDCOM
transmission at any family history centers, the SOUR system name must be registered
with the Family History Department GEDCOM coordinator.  Destination system names
will depend on the purpose for the transmission and can also be obtained from the
GEDCOM coordinator. (See GEDCOM Coordinator's address on the title page.)

Header and trailer records also include other information to help an application
software system process the data in the transmission.  For example, a character set
default for the entire transmission is set in the header using the appropriate
escape sequence for selecting the desired character set (see chapter 5). The header
and trailer are separate from any other protocols attached to the transmission by an
electronic communications network.

HOW TO USE A HEADER

Use a header to begin every GEDCOM transmission. A header has both required and
optional GEDCOM lines. Each line begins with a level number and a tag (in capital
letters) and may be followed by a value.


Required Lines

The following are the lines required in all GEDCOM transmission headers.

      Example:
      Level Tag   Value
      0     HEAD
      1     SOUR  PAF
      2     VERS  2.1
      1     DEST  ANSTFILE
      1     SUBM  @R1@        note: @R1@ is a pointer to a submitter record.
      1     GEDC
      2     VERS  5.0

*     HEAD 
      The first line of a transmission always has the level number 0 and contains
      the tag HEAD. No value is specified. All other lines in the header are at
      subordinate levels--level 1 in the example above.

*     SOUR
      At level 1 a transmission always contains the tag SOUR. The value for the
      SOURce line is the resource identifier (the name of the system or file that
      sends the transmission)  A source resource identifier can be in upper and
      lower case with a length of from 1 to 40 characters.  At level 2 below SOUR is
      a VERS tag to specify the version level of the source system. (A resource
      identifier is a single string of alphanumeric characters that identify any
      system, file, etc. that may participate in a GEDCOM transmission as either a
      sender or a receiver.)  The value (name of the sending file) for the sample
      SOURce line above is PAF 2.1 (Personal Ancestral File, release 2.1).

      The receiving and routing function of the Family History Department associates
      the resource identifier with the actual locations of sender and receiver. This
      permits relocation of systems and files without modification of the systems
      that initiate transmissions, or of data containing pointers to records in
      other systems. The resource identifier is assigned by the Data Administration
      section of the Family History Department.
      *     VERS
            Under SOURce, VERSion is a short phrase identifying which release of
            the product generated the transmission.  The phrase is defined by the
            creator of the product. i.e., VERS 2.1.

*     DEST
      The value for the DESTination line is required when sending data to the Family
      History Department for adding records to the ancestral file or for submitting
      records to TempleReady processing.  This tag value is the resource identifier
      (the name of the system or file to which the transmission is being sent).   A
      source resource identifier can be in upper and lower case with a length of
      from 1 to 40 characters.For example, the value (name of the receiving file)
      for the sample DESTination line in the preceding examples is ANSTFLE,
      indicating that this transmission is destined for the Ancestral File.  The
      value for submitting data to the TempleReady system is "TempleReady".

*     SUBM
      This tag is required and points to a submitter record that is included in the
      transmission.  The submitter record should be in the form as prescribed by the
      Submitter structure in chapter 2.

*     GEDC
      *     VERS
            VERSion under the GEDC tag is a short phrase identifying which release
            of the GEDCOM Standard document was used for the specification for the
            product's GEDCOM implementation.  For this release the VERS line  is
            "VERS 5.0".

Optional Header Lines

You may include optional lines in GEDCOM transmission headers, depending on your
need or preference for additional information. One or more optional lines would
immediately follow the DEST line. The four optional lines shown below are possible
optional lines for the sample transmission on page 3-1. They can occur in any order.

      Example:
      Level Tag   Value
      1     DATE  3 APR 1989
      1     TIME  13:01
      1     CHAR  @#ANSEL@
      1     FILE  YOUNG.GED

*     DATE
      This line contains the date the sender generated the GEDCOM transmission. (For
      more information about the date value, see chapter 4, "How To Record Dates".

*     TIME
      This line contains the time the sender generated the GEDCOM transmission.  The
      value is the time (military time) the file was created. (For more information
      about the time value, see chapter 4 "How To Designate Time" section.)

*     CHAR
      This line is used to change the default character set of an entire
      transmission to another character set. 

      Example:
            Lvl   Tag   Value
            0     HEAD
            1     SOUR  PAF 2.1
            1     DEST  ANSTFILE
            1     CHAR  ANSEL


      The value is the name of the character set. The designation ANSEL is the name
      (value) for the GEDCOM default character set "8-Bit ANSEL". (See chapter 5 for
      more information about character sets.)

      If you use the default character set, the required lines of your GEDCOM
      transmission (the header and trailer) will be coded in 8-Bit ANSEL characters
      restricted to decimal codes 10 (line feed), 13 (carriage return), and 32
      through 126 (printable characters). The characters specified will be identical
      to those in the 7-Bit ASCII (USA version) character set.

      If the computer you are using to send the transmission cannot accommodate the
      default character set, you must convert all required header lines to it (8-Bit
      ANSEL) before sending the transmission to a computer that can accommodate the
      default character set.

      A change of character sets, whether in the header or in the body of the data,
      is effective only for a single transmission. All subsequent transmissions will
      be in the default character set unless it is changed.

*     FILE
      This line contains the name of the GEDCOM transmission file generated by the
      sender.  The value is the name of the file.

HOW TO USE A TRAILER

Use a trailer to end your transmission. A GEDCOM transmission must always be
terminated by one line containing the tag TRLR (trailer) with the level 0. No value
is specified for this line.


NAMING YOUR TRANSMISSION FILE

The GEDCOM transmission data are normally created on DOS compatible diskettes.  By
convention the filename extention (the 3 characters after the period ".") is "GED". 
Macintosh filenames does not use any file extention in their naming.

MULTIPLE DISKETTE FILE NAMES

When the GEDCOM file is too large to fit on a single diskette, the file is divided
after any whole-line (last character is the terminator), and the filename
extension is changed from "GED" to "G##" where "##" is "00" for the second disk,
"01" for the third, etc. (See example below.)  This allows the receiving software to
ensure that disks are read in the correct sequence.

By convention, Macintosh filenames use parens "()" to set apart each diskette with a
different consecutive filename.  Therefore, Macintosh filenames consist of just the
user-supplied name for the first disk, then the user-supplied name concatenated with
"(##)" for subsequent disks where "##" is "00" for the second disk, "01" for the
third disk, etc. (See example below.)

Given that the user- supplied portion of the file name is "SMITH", complete
filenames for a three-disk transmission would be:

      Disk  DOS Filename            Macintosh Filename
      1     SMITH.GED               SMITH
      2     SMITH.G00               SMITH(00)
      3     SMITH.G01               SMITH(01)

The GEDCOM TRLR (trailer) record appears only on the final disk (see Chapter 2).

INTRODUCTION

This chapter contains information you need to implement GEDCOM values. You will find
an explanation about the purpose of these values and how to use them when creating a
transmission. An example of how they appear in GEDCOM lineage-linked format is shown
here.

      Example:
            Cross-Ref.
      Level Identifier  Tag    Value*

      0                 TRLR

The preceding example is a sample transmission of genealogical information about
three individuals who are members of the same family (lineage)--husband, wife, and
child.
WHY VALUES ARE USED

Values provide the actual raw data that is put in context by the proper use of the
GEDCOM-tags so that the data can be properly represented.  In the example on the
preceding page, "Joe/Doe/" is the value specified by the tag NAME under the INDI tag
which is identified as "@3@".  Other values in other lines, such as the birth date
and place, provide additional information about Joe Doe. The values "@4@" specified
by the FAMC tag is a pointer to the FAMily record identified by "@4@" of which Joe
Doe is a child.

The following value types have been defined so as to represent information about
individuals, families, events, and relationships in a standard way: (Other value
types will be defined as the need develops.)

      *     Names Values
                  Enclosed by the NAME tag.
      *     Dates Values
                  Enclosed by the DATE tag.
      *     Places Values
                  Enclosed by the PLAC tag.
      *     Events Values
                  Enclosed by the DEAT, BURI, BIRT, CHR, MARR, EVEN, and other
                  event tags.
      *     Descriptor
                  Event Values
                        Used to further define the kind of event.
                  Relationship Values
                        Used to define a relationship.
                  Association Values
                        Used to define an association.
                  Systems designed to display data from a GEDCOM format should
                  display the descriptor values as well as the subordinate context
                  values.

      *     Information Values
                        Text values enclosed by SOURce and NOTE enclosures to
                        provide supporting facts about the enclosing information or
                        values enclosed by tags that were defined to provide
                        additional facts pertaining to an individual, i.e. RELIgion
                        and OCCUpation tag values.
      *     Pointers Values
                        A marker within a value field which points to other
                        enclosures (structures) of the same value time.
      *     Miscellaneous Values
                        Used to support routing, processing, and routing.
      *     Resource Identifier Values
                        Uniquely identifies SOURce or DESTination systems or
                        products.  Resource identifiers are recommended by the
                        systems creator and registered by the GEDCOM coordinator.

This chapter explains how to record these different value types in a lineage-linked
format, to preserve the relationship of the individuals and to properly format the
support information included in the GEDCOM transmission.
GUIDELINES FOR USING VALUES

Values are optional and of variable length upto a maximum GEDCOM-line length of 255
(this includes the length of the non-value components of a line).  Place each value
in the line with its tag. The value must appear after the space following the tag.
End each value by using a terminator as described later in this chapter. 

The value component may consist of any alpha, numeric, or other characters, except
the escape-sequence prefix symbol "@#" or the escape-delimiter "@".  These symbols
have reserved meanings to the GEDCOM processor defined in the "ESCAPE SEQUENCES"
section below.  The at sign "@" is used for an escape mechanism to identify
pointers, character set changes, calendar changes, or other shifts in representation
rules.  To include the at sign "@" as data, two of them should be sent together
"@@", which represent a single at sign "@" as data.

Corresponding structures or lines (same tag structure) are used to record
information that contains different opinions about the same item.  The preferred
data is listed first so that systems or reports that only accomodate a single value
will show the preferred occurance.  The existence of other possible values may be
indicated in system output with a leading plus "+" sign, if desired.  

ESCAPE SEQUENCES
The escape-sequence symbol "@#" allows for special processing including the
inclusion of non-GEDCOM data.  Currently four classes of escape sequences have been
defined (see chapter 1 for exact grammar):

      *     "@#C....."  for character-set changes.

      *     "@#D....."  for calendar date changes.

      *     "@#L..XXX"  for indicating a non-GEDCOM inclusion of XXX bytes.

      *     "@#F..file name" for indicating a inclusion of data from a file.

HOW TO RECORD NAMES OF INDIVIDUALS

Use the name value with the NAME tag to provide the actual name of an individual.
The following example shows how name values provide the information indicated by the
tag. These values can appear with varying level numbers.

      Example:
      Lvl   Tag   Value
      1     NAME  John Quentin/Doe/

A name consists of a string of one or more name parts, separated by spaces, or by a
slash "/" in the case of the surname. Capitalize the name of a person or place in
the conventional manner--capitalize the first letter of each part and lowercase the
other letters, unless conventional usage is otherwise. For example: McMurray.

Record the name pieces in the order they are spoken; the surname follows the given
name(s), unless the name is traditionally spoken in some other order. The surname is
Immediately preceded and followed by a slash "/".  In cultures where there is no
distiction between surnames and given names, slashes "/" should not be used.

      Examples:

      William Lee/Parry/     (Parry is surname)
      William/Parry/Lee      (Surname Parry spoken in middle)
      /Parry/                (No given names)
      William                (No surname)
      William/Lee Parry/     (Lee Parry is surname)

If diacritics or special characters are present in a name, preserve them in the
manner referred to in chapter 5, "GEDCOM Character Sets."

Use ellipses--three periods "..."--to indicate missing or illegible name pieces.
      
      Examples:
      William Lee/Pa.../            (Part of surname is illegible)
      William .../Parry/            (Second given name is illegible)

Names of individuals who were known by different names should be recorded in the
manner shown below:

      Example:
      Lvl   Tag   Value
      0     INDI
      1     NAME  George/Lowther/
      1     NAME  Geoff/Louder/


HOW TO RECORD DATES


Calendar

You specify a calendar for a date by following these three steps:

      1.    Start with the escape sequence indicator "@#" and a "D".
      2.    Type the name of the calendar.
      3.    End the designation with the terminator "@".

      Example:
      @#DARABIC@        Arabic calendar
      @#DHEBREW@        Hebrew calendar
      @#DFRENCH R@      French Republic calendar
      @#DGREGORIAN@     Gregorian calendar
      @#DJULIAN@        Julian calendar
      @#DROMAN@         Roman calendar
      @#DUNKNOWN@       date from unknown calendar

For further information about approved calendars, contact the GEDCOM coordinator,
see GEDCOM Coordinator's address on the title page.

DATES
Place the date in the same line as the DATE tag, immediately after the space
following the tag. Dates are of two kinds: regular and irregular. 

Regular dates are bonafide dates in a controlled format from the conventional
Gregorian calendar. Follow this procedure to record these dates:

            29 FEB 1960      10 JAN 1802
            1 JUN 1802       1802

Type the day (one or two characters) first, then the month (capitalize the first
three letters of the English name of the month; do not use a period at the end), and
then the year (four-character numeric year). The day and month may be omitted if
unknown.

Irregular dates or dates that cannot fit the controlled date format. Irregular dates
are typically treated as unformatted strings of characters. Record them exactly as
they appear in the source. The following are some of the irregular date types and
examples:
      *     A date from a calendar other than the conventional Gregorian calendar.
            Identify this date with "@#D" and the name of the calendar.
                  Examples:
                  @#DRoman@MDCCCXV
                  @#DHebrew@26TAM5742

      *     Pre-1752 English calendar
                  Examples:
                  4/5 January 1751/52
                  24 7ber 1725

      *     Partial date (except where only the year is known; a year alone
            constitutes a regular date) 
                  Example:
                  5 June (year missing)

      *     Illegible date.
                  Example:
                  5 June... (year present but illegible)

      *     Ambiguous date
                  Example:
                  7-12-84 (July 12th or December 7th?; 1984 or 1884?)

      *     Approximate date
                  Examples:
                  ABT 1850
                  BEF 3 MAR 1913
                  BET 1904 AND 1905

      *     Date range
                  Example:
                  FROM 1904 TO 1905
                  FROM 1904 (indefinite future)
                  TO 1905 (indefinite beginning)

      *     Feast date
                  Example:
                  2 days after Easter, 1690

      *     Dates for eras B.C. (before Christ) are recorded with the indicator
            B.C. appended after the date.  A.D. (anno domini) dates are assumed if
            the B.C. indicator is missing.

                  Example:
                  600 B.C.

HOW TO RECORD PLACES (Localities)

A place name consists of one or more jurisdiction names (indicating one or more
units In a political, ecclesiastical, or geographical hierarchy). Each jurisdiction
name may consist of one or more name pieces (separated by spaces, such as Idaho
Falls). Each name making up the full name is separated from the other by a comma (a
space following each comma is optional).

The following examples show how place names appear in a GEDCOM transmission.

      Examples:
      Lvl   Tag   Value
      2     PLAC  Illinois
      2     PLAC  Idaho Falls,Bonneville,Idaho
      2     PLAC  Chicago, Illinois
      2     PLAC  Iowa

Follow these three steps to record the names of places:

1.    Place the actual name of the place or locality in the same line as the PLAC
      tag, after the space that Immediately follows the tag.

2.    List the jurisdictions in order of increasing size, smallest first. The number
      of jurisdictions varies, depending on the source.

      *     If an intermediate jurisdiction is known to exist, but its name cannot
            be determined, indicate its absence by using adjacent commas. For
            example, a city and state may be given, but not a county.

            Example:
            Green,, New York

      *     If the country referred to in the data, and the countries in which the
            data is prepared or used, are different, be sure the place name
            includes the country jurisdiction or an internationally recognized
            abbreviation, without periods.

            Example:
            Salt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, USA

3.    Spell the name Pieces exactly as they appear in the source.

      *     Use the capitalization that appears in the source.
      *     If a name listed on the original record appears to be misspelled, be
            sure to preserve this spelling. Do not change it.

            Example:
            Green, Chenango County, Now York
            (Do not change Now to New; leave it Now.)
      *     If part or all of a place name is illegible, use ellipses--three
            periods "..."--to indicate exactly what part of the name is illegible.

            Example:
            Green, ...ango County, New York

HOW TO RECORD EVENTS

Use the tag that is the name of the event you want to record, if the tag for that
event is in the appendix. For example, use BIRT for birth. If the tag is not in the
appendix, use the event tag--EVEN. Then specify the name of the event as the value.
Dates and places of events are usually recorded as related GEDCOM lines. Here is an
example of an event and related Information:
      Example:
      Lvl   Tag   Value
      1     BIRT
      2     DATE  1836
      2     PLAC  Illinois
      1     EVEN  Service in World War II
      2     DATE  12 Oct 1942 to 5 Aug 1945

HOW TO DESIGNATE TIME

Use the time value to identify when a request was sent or when the event occurred.
Use this value with the TIME tag. Time information is part of the header record (see
chapter 3 for more information about the header). Follow these steps to designate
time:

1.    Place the time value--the time local to the event--in the same line as the
      TIME tag, after the space immediately following the tag.

2.    Be sure to use 24-hour clock (military time) notation. Put the hour of the day
      first, then the number of minutes into the hour, and optionally the number of
      seconds into the minute.  Separate each level with a colon ":" character.

      Examples:
      Lvl   Tag   Value
      0     HEAD
      1     SOUR  PAF
      1     TIME  13:25:10
      0     INDI
      1     BIRT
      2     DATE  12 June 1950
      3     TIME  14:53
HOW TO USE POINTERS

Use pointers to show how information in one or more lines of a GEDCOM transmission
is related to information in another line of the same transmission.  Each pointer
must contain exactly the same characters as its corresponding cross-reference
identifier (which occurs only once in the cross-reference identifier component in
order to "point" to the desired relationship. Multiple (identical) pointers can
appear in any record to point to the same cross-reference identifier.

      *     Use each pointer with the tag and level number that corresponds to the
            appropriate line of information.

      *     Be sure that the pointer follows the tag in the same line and that it
            appears after the space Immediately following the tag.

      *     Begin and end each pointer with the delimiter symbol "@".

      Examples:
            @121@       @DE@
            @X-x@       @F1-1@

In the example below the pointer "@1@" in the HUSBAND tag in the second line of the
family record refers to the individual whose name is John Quentin Doe in the first
individual record. The pointer "@1@" points to the cross-reference identifier "@1@"
to show this relationship. The characters for the pointer and the corresponding
cross-reference identifier are identical.

      Example:
      Lvl   Identifer   Tag  Value
      0     @1@   INDI
      1           NAME  John Quentin/Doe/
      0     @4@   FAM
      1           HUSB  @1@

You can use most alpha, numeric, or other characters to create pointers--including
your computer's own native keys, or record numbers from its internal data base
structure. You cannot, however, use the following three characters:

*     "@" (the delimiter symbol)
*     "#" (the number sign, also known as the U.S. pound sign, which is ASCII code
      35)
*     The terminator symbol (see the Terminator section later in this chapter.)
*     The colon character ":" usage within pointers is reserved (See the syntax for
      xref_id and pointer in chapter 1 ).

HOW TO USE OTHER VALUES

Character Set

Two standard character sets are used most often for GEDCOM transmissions': 8-Bit
ANSEL and ASClI.  The default character set is 8-Bit ANSEL--Extended Latin Alphabet
Coded Character Set for Bibliographic Use (American National Standards [ANSI]
Z39.47-1985)--because it handles a wider variety of diacritics and special
characters than any other character set.

If your transmission does not require diacritics, you may wish to use ASCII (USA
version--ANSI 8 Bit), if your computer already supports it. In the future, you will
be able to use the binary character set to facilitate transmission of photographs
and other bit-mapped graphics. Other character sets can also be used for the
transmissions. You will find more information about character sets in chapter 5,
"Using Character Sets in GEDCOM".

You can change the character set any time in any system associated with any data. To
change the character set, follow the procedure outlined in chapter 5.

A GEDCOM line must contain a terminator which cannot occur as data in a value.

Terminator

The terminator marks the end of a GEDCOM line--it separates one line from another. A
terminator (not visible on the screen) produces a line feed. In ANSEL, the
terminator symbol is the line feed (decimal code 10 or hex code 0A) or carriage
return (decimal code 13 or hex code 0D), or a combination of the two.  The
terminator is an invisible carriage-return character in the examples used in this
document.

                           USING CHARACTER SETS IN GEDCOM

INTRODUCTION

This chapter lists and explains the character sets that can be used with GEDCOM. It
also provides the escape sequences and conventions required to change from one
character set to another during a transmission.

This specification does not include implementation methods for multilingual
processing, such as keyboard arrangements, sorting sequences, or character and
graphic representations (font styles, proportional spacing, etc.) on the CRT or
Printers.


WHY VARIOUS CHARACTER SETS ARE USED

GEDCOM accommodates several standard character sets to facilitate the sharing of
diverse genealogical data in many different languages, and to meet different user
needs. These character sets are listed and explained below.


8-Bit ANSEL--The Default Character Set

The 8-Bit ANSEL (American National Standard for Extended Latin Alphabet Coded
Character Set for Bibliographic Use, Z39.47, 1985 copyright) is the default
character set for GEDCOM. It is used for all transmissions of information, unless
another character set is specified.

The 8-Bit ANSEL is a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
It is the only character set that will handle a wide variety of diacritics and
special characters for Romanized languages. (A diacritic is a graphic mark, Point,
or sign used with alphabetic graphic characters to distinguish them by form or
sound.) GEDCOM accommodates all diacritics that are included in Family History
Department computer systems text and bibliographic information. Use the 8-Bit ANSEL
character set when your transmission must preserve the full integrity of original
Roman-alphabetic
languages, including diacritics and special characters.

The 8-Bit ANSEL is also known by two other names: (1) the American National Standard
for Extended Latin Alphabet Coded Character Set for Bibliographic Use (American
National Standards [ANSI] Z39.47-1985) and (2) the American Library Association
character set, widely used in library systems, including the MARC (Machine-Readable
Catalog) format.

You will find the standard for 8-Bit ANSEL on the last five pages of this chapter.
It is reproduced with permission from the American National Standards Institute.
Copies of this character set may be purchased from the American National Standards
Institute at 1430 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10018.

The standard 8-Bit ANSEL includes the following which is shown in table form in
Appendix B of this document:

      *     An 8-Bit Code Table consisting of ANSEL and ASCII codes, page B-1
      *     An explanation of the codes, page B-2
      *     ANSEL Nonspacing Graphic Characters, page B-3
      *     ASCII Control Characters, page B-4
      *     ASCII Graphic Characters, page B-5

Character-set codes 0 through 127 are the same for 8-Bit ANSEL and 8-Bit ASCII (USA
version--ANSI 8 Bit). Character-set codes 128 through 255 are unique to the ANSEL
character set.

ASCII (USA version) (ANSI 8 Bit)

If you have no need for diacritics or special characters, and if you are not
transmitting binary data, you will find it convenient to use ASCII (USA version--
ANSI 8 Bit) if your computer already supports it. This is a standard of the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI). Most of the normal printable characters of
ANSEL and ASClI (USA version--ANSI 8 Bit) are identical.

Binary and Other Character Sets

When requested, binary formats for transmission of photographs and other bit-mapped
graphics will be defined or adopted.

How to Change Character Sets

The procedure for changing character sets depends on whether you wish to change the
character set for an entire transmission, or for just part of a transmission.

For an Entire Transmission

To change the character set for an entire transmission, do two things:

      1.    Specify the new character set in the character set line of the header
            record. (For more information about the header record, see chapter 3.)

      2.    Use the one-word name of the character set you want, following the CHAR
            tag in the same line.

      The example below shows the specification in the header record.

      Example:

      Lvl   Tag   Value
      0     HEAD
      1     SOUR  PAF
      2     VERS  2.1
      1     DEST  ANSTFILE
      1     CHAR  ASCII

For Part of a Transmission

To change the character set for part of a transmission, follow this procedure:

      1.    Select the registered one-word name approved for the character set you
            want for your transmission. GEDCOM transmissions are automatically sent
            in 8-Bit ANSEL, unless you specify another character set. Following are
            the one-word names already registered for this designation the
            character set being used:

            *     ANSEL.  8-Bit ANSEL character set (default)
            *     ASCII.  ASCII (USA version--ANSI 8 Bit)
            *     BINARY. Binary data (future use)

      2.    Make sure the character set appears on the same line as the rest of the
            data for the character set.

            Example:
            @#CASCII@.  This is the designation for the character set for ASCIl
                        (USA version--ANSI 8 Bit) with the symbols that begin and
                        end it.

      3.    Designate the character set. Begin with the escape-sequence symbol
            followed by "C" (C for character set).  The escape-sequence symbol is a
            combination of a "C", an "@" and a "#" to form "@#C". Then type the
            name of the character set. End the designation with a "@" (the
            terminator for the escape-sequence), as shown in the examples below:

            Examples:
            @#CANSEL@   8-Bit ANSEL character set (default)
            @#CASCII@   ASCII (USA version) (ANSI 8 Bit)
            @#CBINARY@  Binary data (future use)

      The first three characters "@#C" alert the computer that information will be
      sent or received in a new character set. The actual change in character set
      starts with the first character that follows the closing "@". This change is
      in effect until the length indicated has been reached, the end-of-transmission
      symbol (TRLR) has been encountered, or another change in character set is
      specified. 

      If you are using the default character set (8-Bit ANSEL), make sure that all
      diacritic and special characters immediately precede the character they are to
      be associated with. If you are using a character set other than ANSEL, or if
      the data must change from one character set to another, indicate the change by
      using a character-set change escape sequence.

            Example:
            (space)@#CASCII@

      The escape sequence is context insensitive and may appear anywhere, as many
      times as needed.

                        LINEAGE-LINKED GEDCOM TAG DEFINITION

Introduction

Appendix A is a glossary of the tags approved for use with Lineage-Linked GEDCOM.
(See chapter 2 for an example of the tags in context that describes the Lineage-
Linked structure.)  Every tag must be used within the context shown to ensure
uniformity in the identification of all information transmitted by means of GEDCOM.

The tags are of various types, depending on their role or use in a transmission.
They are used to identify individuals, families, names, dates, places, events,
roles, sex, sources, relationships, control codes and other kinds of data for
computers, computer programs, and computer systems.

The definition for each tag is generally broad enough to cover all uses of the tag.
Other tags have been defined for structures other than those used in the Lineage-
Linked Grammar.  These tags were not included in Appendix A. For a list of these,
contact the GEDCOM Coordinator.

Any new tag needed to enhance the Lineage_Linked form for system specific purposes
may be used and will not violate the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM standard as long as the
approved standard Lineage-Linked GEDCOM grammar context is not violated.  System
builders should register these tags and their definitions with the GEDCOM
Coordinator at the address listed on the title page of this document.  The
Coordinator will evaluate the feasibility of including them as a part of the next
release of the standard.  Suggestions and proposed additions are welcome.  Use the
form "GEDCOM New Tag Proposal" (PFGS3709) provided at the end of the appendix. Be
sure to check the appendix carefully first--the tag in question may already be
defined.
